# Edgechains Sample Project

This project demonstrates an AI-powered recipe generator and meal planner using the Edgechains library.

## Project Overview

The application utilizes the Mistral AI model (via OpenRouter) to:

1.  Generate a recipe based on user-provided ingredients and preferences.
2.  Create a simple meal plan based on the generated recipes.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repo url]`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd edgechains-sample`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable.
5.  Run the application: `npm start`



## Explanations
I have created a simple recipe generator and meal planner using edgechains. I have also added a new OpenRouter api model class to call a different LLM.
